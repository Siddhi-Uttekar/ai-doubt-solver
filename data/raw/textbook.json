        "The  book  reviews  the  development  that  has  taken  place  in  India    in  the  social,",

        "by  no  means  detailed  or  complete.  In  fact,  compelled  by  the  limit  on  the  number",
        "of  pages  in  this  textbook,  it  is  a  rather  cursory  overview  of  approximately  forty",
        "years.  It  takes  note  of  the  economic  policies  of  India  which  relate  to  industry  and",
        "agriculture,  of  the  empowerment  of  women  and  of  development-related  events  connected",

        "take  in  the  future  or  for  higher  education  in  history.  Your  parents  have  been  witness",

        "of  History.  This  year,  using  this  textbook,  we  have  to  teach  the  period  of  years  from",
        "1961  to  2000.  You  will  especially  enjoy  dealing  with  this  textbook  because  you  have",
        "been  a  witness  to  several  of  the  events  mentioned  here.  This  book  includes  the  very  events",
        "that  have  taken  place  around  you.  You  will,  in  a  way,  re-live  those  times.",
        "This  is  the  history  of  the  whole  of  India.  In  view  of  the  limited  number  of  pages",
        "in  the  textbook,  it  is  a  difficult  task  to  present  the  entire  account  of  these  years  with",
        "any  continuity.  We  have  tried  to  include  those  events  which  would  most  appeal  to  students",
        "of  Std  IX  at  their  age.  Taking  some  important  events  as  a  framework,  it  will  be  possible",
        "to  help  students  to  learn  about  the  intervening  events  using  the  Internet.",
        "The  central  theme  of  this  book  is  ‘How  a  newly  independent  State  sets  itself  on  the",
        "road  towards  development’.  This  is  a  country  which  has  the  largest  democratic  system  in",
        "the  world.  An  attempt  has  been  made  to  highlight  the  role  played  in  the  progress  of  such",
        "a  country  by  the  political  and  the  administrative  leadership,  as  well  as  by  scientists,",
        "educationists  and  artists.  Complementing  this,  is  the  other  important  part  of  this  book,",
        "namely,  the  faith  of  the  citizens  of  India  in  democracy  and  the  fight  put  up  by  the  general",
        "public  in  its  defence.  That  every  individual  has  a  social  responsibility  and  that  the  nation",
        "is  bigger  than  the  political  leadership  is  the  message  that  the  public  has  always  sent  out",

        "interaction  and  exchanges  of  many  kinds  between  nations  have  increased  greatly.  We",

        "in  the  textbook  for  the  effective  application  of  such  methods.  It  is  expected  that  teachers",
